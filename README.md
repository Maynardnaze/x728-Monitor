# x728
Monitor for the x728 Pi UPS.
This will perform a safe shutdown after a specified timeout once the external is cut.
This is tested,and developed using Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 4.
Currently it also works on a Raspberry Pi 3b+.  However this support will not be guaranteed.

Steps:
1.  Enable the ds1307 overlay, and i2c in the /boot/config.txt
  * add ds1307 to the dtoverlay line
    * dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d,ds1307
  * Add/uncomment dtparam=i2c_arm=on.
2. reboot
3. Run sudo ./setup.sh
4. run with sudo ./x728-monitor.py or sudo python3 x728-monitor.py
5. Optional,  To start as a servive.  Stop any running instance, and run
  sudo systectl start x728Monitor.service
  or
  sudo service x728Monitor.service start

To disable the service to prevent starting at boot, run
  sudo systemctl disable x728Monitor.service
  or
  sudo service x728Monitor.service disable


# Coming soon
